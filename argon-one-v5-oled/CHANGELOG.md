# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-08-19

- Add the official Home Assistant S6-overlay AppArmor startup baseline.
- Permit read-only access to the app payload copied into the image root.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-19

### Security / Permissions (breaking)
- **Removed GPIO entirely**: `gpio: false`, no `gpiod` dependency, no
  button monitoring thread, no GPIO4 button support this release (see
  repository README's GPIO4 assessment section).
- **Removed host power control entirely**: no `host/reboot`,
  `host/shutdown`, or any Supervisor POST call anywhere in the codebase.
  `supervisor_api.py`'s client is now `GET`-only.
- **Removed the config volume**: no more `map: config:rw`; the add-on
  never reads or writes Home Assistant's `/config`.
- **Lowered Supervisor role**: `hassio_role` changed from `manager` to
  `default` (lowest viable, for read-only status only). This assumption
  needs live verification - see README.
- **Restricted I2C access**: from all of `/dev/i2c-0` through
  `/dev/i2c-26` down to `/dev/i2c-1` only, in both `config.yaml` and
  `apparmor.txt`.
- **Re-enabled AppArmor enforcement** (`apparmor: true`, was disabled to
  work around GPIO access which no longer exists) with a tightened
  profile that explicitly denies `/config`, `/ssl`, `/share`, `/backup`.
- Restricted `arch` to `aarch64` only (Raspberry Pi 5 has no
  armhf/armv7 target).

### Added
- **Exceptions-first alert screens**: a new pure fault-evaluation engine
  (`faults.py`) that supersedes routine screen rotation with prioritized
  alerts for excessive CPU temperature, a stopped fan when cooling is
  expected, missing/old backups, low storage, unavailable HA status, and
  pending updates. Fully unit tested (`tests/test_faults.py`).
- New `cpu` screen now also shows 1/5/15-minute load average
  (`get_load_average()`), not just instantaneous usage.
- New `uptime` screen.
- New configurable alert thresholds: `cpu_temp_alert_c`,
  `fan_min_temp_c`, `backup_max_age_hours`, `storage_min_free_percent`.
- New `tests/test_config_safety.py` asserting the least-privilege
  invariants above directly against `config.yaml`/`apparmor.txt`/source,
  so a future privilege regression fails tests.
- Repository-level `repository.yaml` and a new top-level `README.md`
  covering install, permissions, status contract, maintenance, and
  rollback.

### Changed
- **Storage now reads `/data` instead of `/`**: the container root
  filesystem is an overlay and does not represent real host free space;
  `/data` is always bind-mounted from the host's actual data partition.
  If unobtainable, the screen now shows "Unavailable" instead of a
  possibly-misleading number.
- **HA status now distinguishes "zero" from "unavailable"**: previously
  a failed/forbidden Supervisor call silently looked identical to "0
  updates" / healthy backups. `get_ha_system_status()` now returns an
  explicit `available` flag, and the `hastatus` screen shows "N/A" when
  false.
- Default `screen_list` updated to
  `"clock hastatus cpu fan ram storage ip uptime"` (dropped `logo` and
  `qr` from the default rotation; both remain available as opt-in
  screens).
- Credits splash screen no longer generates a QR code (removed a
  startup dependency on QR generation for a purely cosmetic screen that
  pointed at a specific fork's repository rather than the one the user
  installed from); attribution is now text-only on screen, in full in
  the repository README.

### Removed
- `smbus2` and `cbor2` from `requirements.txt` (unused dependencies).
- `libgpiod`/`py3-libgpiod` from the Docker image.
- Unused `addon.json` (Home Assistant Supervisor only reads
  `config.yaml`; this file was dead, drifting metadata).
- All button-hold reboot/shutdown confirmation UI and logic.
